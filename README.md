# Zendesk Extension for Magento

This extension makes Zendesk work seamlessly with Magento to enable stores to deliver great customer support. **Features include:**

- Enable Single Sign-on with Zendesk
- Create support tickets without leaving Magento
- Display relevant support tickets on order & customer dashboards
- Create support tickets from Contact Us requests
- Easily add a feedback tab to your site

The latest stable version of the extension can be installed via the [Magento Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/catalog/product/view/id/15129/) marketplace.

## API

### General Notes

The extension provides its own custom RESTful API, which is intended to be used by the [Magento Zendesk App](https://github.com/zendesk/magento_app). The custom API allows for a consistent interface across all Magento versions, regardless of whether they support XML-RPC, SOAP or REST interfaces, and provides exactly the data that the app requires.

The base URL of the API is `http://your_site_base_url/zendesk/api/`.

### Authentication

The API can be enabled in the Zendesk settings page in the Magento admin panel. Using it requires a token to be generated and be sent to the API in an `Authorization` header:

    Authorization: Token token="your token goes here"

### Responses

You may receive the following errors from any of the API calls:

* 401 Not authorised
  
  Authentication token is not valid.
  
* 403 API access disabled

  API access has been disabled in the Magento admin panel. It will need to be enabled before using the API.

* 404 Resource does not exist

  The requested resource was not found.

All API methods return content as JSON objects following the format set out in the method definitions below.

### Available Methods

#### GET /customers/`<email>`

Will return customer information for the customer with the provided email address. If no customer record exists but orders have been placed then the email is treated as a guest and only the orders they have placed are returned. If no customer record exists and there are no orders using the email then a 404 error is returned.

Note that Magento allows scoping customers either globally or per website. If set to be scoped per website then this method will return the first customer which matches the email address, regardless of the website they belong to.

**Response Format**

Guest customers only have the `guest` and `orders` keys returned.

    DELETE FROM `core_config_data` WHERE `path` LIKE 'zendesk/%';
